Consider your audience when you are creating data visualization.

<h5>Key questions</h5>
* Who is your audience?
* What is their familiarity with data visualization?
* How much information do they need?


<h3 id="general-users">If your user group is general (i.e. the American public)</h3>
For charts meant for the general public, stick with basic and most common chart types that people can easily understand. A series of bar, pie or line charts can walk the consumer though the data. To this extent, using a graph that shows the whole of the data, then drills down into specifics helps frame and give context to what they are seeing. Adding emphasis and labels will help highlight the point of the visual and tell the story of the information.

<h3 id="specific-users">If your user is refined to a specific audience</h3>
When youâ€™re creating visualizations for a specific target, take into consideration their familiarity with data and visualizations. More complex stories might necessitate more complex visuals. Aim not to create solely exploratory experiences, but to have meaning and a point to engage the user and walk them through the data.
