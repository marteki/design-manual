Using the appropriate font not only increases consistency with the CFPB brand, but assures legibility and good visual hierarchy. Proper labeling and titles help users quickly understand the chart and increases comprehension as well as helping with accessibility.

<h5>Key questions</h5>
* Does your chart have a descriptive title and subtitle so someone who cannot see the chart could understand the general trends?
* Have you included notes and a data source?
* Is it clear when the data is from?

<h3 id="font">Font</h3>
All data, labels and titles for data visualizations should be in a sans-serif font. The preferred choices for fonts are: Avenir Next over Arial, and Arial over another sans serif font.

While serif fonts are generally easier to read for long blocks of text, data visualizations rarely include long blocks. The lack of serifs, especially on numbers, helps cut down on the amount of lines and visual clutter. This lack also increases the legibility of small text by eliminating thin serifs.

<h3 id="titles">Titles</h3>
Titles should be as descriptive as possible to give users a sense of what the chart will be about. This not only provides users a framework of what they are looking at, but also helps with 508 accessibility and decreases the amount of text necessary in alt tags.

<h3 id="labels-keys">Labels and keys</h3>
Wherever possible, charts should not include a key, and data should be directly labeled. This reduces the cognitive burden for the user so they are not hunting for labels and trying to connect colors to the data.
